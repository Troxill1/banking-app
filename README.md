This is a complete C#-based banking system that offers:
- account creation (current, savings, loan);
- deposit, withdrawal and loan payment operations;
- transaction history viewing with sorting, filtering and export;
- statistics (data aggregation) with export;
all through a GUI built on Windows Forms.

This project demonstrates strong OOP design, modularity and scalability which make it an excellent reflection of C# programming principles.
